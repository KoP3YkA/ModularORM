## What to do if you found a bug / want to add a feature?

First, [create an issue](https://github.com/KoP3YkA/modular-orm/issues) describing the bug or proposal in detail.  
Then, fork the repository to your own profile. In your fork, create a branch whose name clearly reflects the purpose of the PR.  
For example: `fix_some_not_work`, `feat_new_relation`, etc.

Make the necessary commits in this branch, following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Then create a PR to our repository.  
The PR title should briefly summarize the changes, and the description should provide a detailed explanation.  
After that, reference your PR in the related issue using `#issue_number`, and wait for the review.

## Tasks

You can also create issues without solving them yourself.  
If you find a task youâ€™d like to work on, comment on the issue stating that you're taking it.

## Have a question?

Feel free to ask in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/KoP3YkA/modular-orm/discussions).
